# Summary
Islamic scholars model the transmission of Ḥadīth texts using isnād graphs. Nodes represent people transmitting texts and edges denote transmissions of texts between transmitters. Traditionally, such graphs are drawn by hand. As isnād graphs can become really large, this task can be very tedious. Here, we present the `isnalyser` toolset, a simple tool to automate the drawing of isnād graphs. Moreover, our proposed application allows users to interactively inspect their data. We provide a `Python` package as well as a `Javascript`-based application, with the `isnalyserjs`.

# Motivation
Tracing the roots of Ḥadīth texts is an active topic of debate. Isnād graphs provide a scientific approach to disentangling the web of possible transmissions. Moreover, resulting visualizations are a foundation for discourse...

# Citations

Citations to entries in paper.bib should be in
[rMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
format.

If you want to cite a software repository URL (e.g. something on GitHub without a preferred
citation) then you can do it with the example BibTeX entry below for @fidgit.

For a quick reference, the following citation commands can be used:
- `@author:2001`  ->  "Author et al. (2001)"
- `[@author:2001]` -> "(Author et al., 2001)"
- `[@author1:2001; @author2:2001]` -> "(Author1 et al., 2001; Author2 et al., 2002)"

# Figures

Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% }
