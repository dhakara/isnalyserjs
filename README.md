# isnalyserjs
The Interactive Isnalyser


## Automated isnād tree visualisations

For scholars studying Ḥadīth texts, drawing an __isnād__ tree with more than 40 transmitters is a tedious work and finding the right medium to desplay it fully can even prove to be impossible. The `isnalyser` is a simple program for the automation of __isnād__ trees drawing and their customisable display in handy formats.

## The motivation behind the project

The `isnalyser` aims at facilitating the analysis of large quantity of __aḥādīth__ and more specifically their chains of transmiters or __asānid__ by allowing scholars to visualise these chains of transmitters quickly in a complete graph that includes geo-spatial and chronological information.
The `isnalyserjs` is an interactive approach to this problem. 



## Installation for Development
